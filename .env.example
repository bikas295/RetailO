# Backend Environment Variables
PORT=3001

# Database
# The backend uses SQLite, so no external database connection needed
# Make sure sales.db is created by running the backend locally first

# Frontend will connect to backend via proxy in development
# In production (Vercel), it will use the Render.com backend URL
